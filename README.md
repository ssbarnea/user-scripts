## Gerrit 2 Facelift (CSS)

Makes the UI of gerrit more practical to use, by making it possible to use on split-screens.

The main change is on how the changes table is rendered, one example can be seen below where this user script ensures that the table does not expan current window width. 

If you have an user-script enabling browser extension like [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [GreaseMonkey](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey), you only need to add click [here](https://github.com/ssbarnea/user-scripts/raw/master/src/gerrit2-facelift.user.js) to install the script.

This script aims to easy the gerrit user life until the instance is updartd to a 3.x UI which sorted most of these issues.
